<h1>Intro</h1>
<h2>What is this thing?</h2>
<p>The app is meant to help with picking teams in our weekly pool. The idea is, once the spreads have been set, we can login and select the teams we think are going to win that week.</p>
<p>Moreover, we can discuss each game with each other and try to make the best decision we can each week. If you get some last minute gossip on a team, add it to the comments, and help us pick the winner.</p>
<p>We can also see how we're doing every week. We can get an overview of how we did each week, and we can see how the rest of us faired.</p>
<h2>Why did you write this?</h2>
I have a weird addiction to coding. I got bored a few weekends while my picks weren't panning out, and I thought I could put it together fairly quickly. I thought we needed something more colraborative. It is by no means complete, and I do have other ideas for it, but only if you guys find it useful. If you want more, email me! If you hate it, let me know how I can make it better.
