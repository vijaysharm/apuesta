A full stack site to manage my friends and mine's 
weekly NFL picks. Users can log in and see which 
teams are playing, what the score is if there one
the spread taken from proline, select the team they
believe is going to beat the spread that week, see
what the others in the league have picked as their
winners, and see if they were right or wrong once 
the scores have been added

* As an admin, i can set who we pick in a 
  consensus, and can override consensus picks
* Move team data from server to client in a utils
  package (reduces the amount of traffic is sent 
  over the wire)
* Make the left most column of the picks page clickable
  to see the game info

  to the bottom, if i choose a game from this week
  from the bottom of the page (makes the game info
  page look like it didnt load)

  server (should you be throwing? or sending back
  error codes?)
* Support seasons beyond 2013
