A full stack site to manage my friends and mine's 
weekly NFL picks. Users can log in and see which 
teams are playing, what the score is if there one
the spread taken from proline, select the team they
believe is going to beat the spread that week, see
what the others in the league have picked as their
winners, and see if they were right or wrong once 
the scores have been added

TODO
* As a user I can see stats about my winning
  percentage overall
* As a user, I should have a way of seeing the CBS
  picks
* As a user, I should be able to change my selection
  from the either the picks and game page.
* As a user, I can see the consensus picks for a week
* As a user I should be able to upvote for consensus pick
* As a user I can see stats on the winning 
  percentage for the whole season of everyone 
  in my pool
* As an admin, i can set who the admin is
* As an admin, i can set who we pick in a 
  consensus, and can override consensus picks
* Move team data from server to client in a utils
  package (reduces the amount of traffic is sent 
  over the wire)
* Make the left most column of the picks page clickable
  to see the game info
* Fix the game info page, which is scrolled all the
  to the bottom, if i choose a game from this week
  from the bottom of the page (makes the game info
  page look like it didnt load)
* Improve error handing with response types from the
  server (should you be throwing? or sending back
  error codes?)
* Support seasons beyond 2013
* Remove the migration so that in the case of a failed
  query, you resort the file for results, instead of pre
  populating the database. That way, when you make a change
  and need to upgrade, you dont mess up the live system
* Have a way of exporting data, and importing it so you can
  restore a system in case of a mistake on upgrade.
* Have a way of getting scores from an external source
* Have a way of getting spreads from an external source
* Fix the "Please ensure" warning message from Mongodb
